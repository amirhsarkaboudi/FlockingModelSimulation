# ABM Flocking Model Simulation

This repository contains a simulation of flocking behavior using an **Agent-Based Model (ABM)**. The simulation demonstrates how individual agents (referred to as "boids") move collectively by following simple flocking rules: **Separation**, **Alignment**, and **Cohesion**.

## Features

- **Separation**: Boids avoid crowding their neighbors.
- **Alignment**: Boids align their direction with nearby boids.
- **Cohesion**: Boids move toward the center of mass of nearby boids.
- The simulation visualizes the collective motion of boids over time.

## Some Ideas
These local interactions between agents lead to the emergence of complex, coordinated behavior without any central control. The global pattern, a flock of birds moving in unison, is an emergent property that arises from the agents' adherence to these simple rules. This mirrors how self-organizing systems in nature—such as bird flocks or fish schools—function, where global patterns emerge from local interactions between individuals. By simulating these interactions in code, our model demonstrates how self-organization can produce orderly, collective behavior from seemingly independent and simple actions.
