# ABM Flocking Model Simulation

This repository contains a simulation of flocking behavior using an **Agent-Based Model (ABM)**. The simulation demonstrates how individual agents (referred to as "boids") move collectively by following simple flocking rules: **Separation**, **Alignment**, and **Cohesion**.

## Features

- **Separation**: Boids avoid crowding their neighbors.
- **Alignment**: Boids align their direction with nearby boids.
- **Cohesion**: Boids move toward the center of mass of nearby boids.
- The simulation visualizes the collective motion of boids over time.
